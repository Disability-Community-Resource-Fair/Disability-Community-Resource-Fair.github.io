Family Support Services at UCP of Central PA works to connect local families throughout Cumberland, Dauphin, and Perry counties with resources in our area. We offer programs such as Friday Evening Respite for individuals ages 5+, and Sibshops for siblings of children with disabilities. We also offer family fun events, trainings, and workshops throughout the year. Our goal is to give families the connection and support they need while also giving them the opportunity to have fun and relax in a safe and accepting environment. If you, or someone you know, needs guidance or support with disability information or resources, please reach out to Family Support Services at UCP of Central PA!
