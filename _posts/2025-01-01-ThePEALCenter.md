Through our unwavering commitment to inclusion and our guiding values, we empower families and individuals to be included in their home schools and access high quality, coordinated physical and behavioral health care. PEAL’s services are provided at no charge to families as they are funded by private donations and federal, state, and private grants. The mission of the PEAL Center is to educate and empower families to ensure that children, youth and young adults with disabilities and special health care needs lead rich, active lives as full members of their schools and communities.

The PEAL Center is an organization of parents/family members of children with disabilities and special health care needs and persons with disabilities who educate and guide:
- Families of children and youth, ages birth to 26, who have disabilities and/or special health care needs
- Professionals and others who work with children and youth who have disabilities and/or special health care needs
- Youth and young adults up to age 26 who have disabilities and/or special health care needs
