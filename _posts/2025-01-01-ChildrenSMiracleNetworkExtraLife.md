Gaming for good is about playing the games that bring us joy to help bring others joy. EVERYONE is welcome! Whether you're a daily Wordle player, a member of an eSports team, a mini-golf expert or an Animal Crossing architect, there's space for you to raise funds for kids in need through your way to play. Turn your love for gaming into dollars raised for Penn State Health Children’s Hospital.
