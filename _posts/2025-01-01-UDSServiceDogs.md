Service dogs are dedicated companions that provide more than puppy love–they can help with deep pressure therapy, physical task such as: retrieval of items, alert a support person,  and much, much more.

Our service dogs are trained from puppyhood to the age of at least two years old by a team of dedicated volunteers and professionals. Then, they’re partnered with individuals who have a mobility disability, autism, or Veterans with PTSD to help them live their possibility. Additionally, we train facility dogs to work in schools or other facilities, to help students or adults in a therapeutic manner, learn to navigate social and emotional obstacles of life.
