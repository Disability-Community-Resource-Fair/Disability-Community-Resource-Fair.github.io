TACHP supports children with complex medical needs and their families. The program focuses on children who use medical technology at home, such as feeding tubes, ventilators, oxygen, or other specialized equipment.

I work directly with families to connect them to services and supports. This includes care coordination, referrals, education, and advocacy. I help families understand systems, complete paperwork, and access community and medical resources.
