TechOWL is PA's designated Assistive Technology Act Program, part of the Institute on Disabilities at Temple University, College of Education and Human Development. TechOWL has many programs that can help you get assistive technology for different needs. These programs include a statewide lending library with over 1500 devices for people to borrow on a short-term basis. We also offer free demonstrations of devices to help in the trial process. These services are available to people of all ages.
