UCP's Family Support Team helps connect families with disabilities to resources throughout the area. The team organizes activities to offer families the opportunity to have fun and connect with other families in an accepting environment. They also offer programs such as Early Intervention, Friday Evening Respite, and Sibshops (for siblings of children with disabilities), as well as Parent Training events. Whatever your family's disability needs may be, Family Support at UCP is here to help!
