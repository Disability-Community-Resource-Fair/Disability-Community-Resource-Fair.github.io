I help frustrated parents of students primarily ages 12-21 years old get the IEP and school supports they need to be successful in school, and prepare for life in the real world. Virtual services nationwide + in-person in Berks County, PA. I am not a lawyer and I do not give legal advice. All advocacy and IEP decisions are your own.
