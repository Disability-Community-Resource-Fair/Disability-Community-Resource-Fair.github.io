The Reading Public Museum, with The Neag Planetarium, is a center for science and art discovery. We are also a certified autism center through IBCCES and pride ourselves on making sure everyone feels welcome at our institution. RPM has also hosted organizations to help train service dogs and provide unique experiences with accommodations as needed to make every experience the best of what we have to offer. Throughout the year, we also host a variety of sensory programming for our community.
