We are a non-traditional Occupational Therapy Business in York, PA. We are specializing in Auditory and Sensory Precessing/Integration for adults and children starting at 18 months. Through tailored treatment programs,  based on the Polyvagal Theory, we are able to address root causes; and therefore, lasting outcomes through Nervous System Regulation. Our 30+ researched-backed filtered listening music treatments, and in combination with primitive reflex integration and other comprehensive hands-on techniques, we achieve faster processing, and lasting results. In addition, we offer parent support treatments, so they can feel empowered supporting their children.
