Kira’s Grace Foundation is a nonprofit in South Central Pennsylvania dedicated to empowering and supporting families of children and adults with disabilities. We provide peer-led advocacy, resource navigation, direct assistance for essential needs, equipment through our “Butterfly Exchange,” and inclusive community events that connect families to hope, support, and each other.
