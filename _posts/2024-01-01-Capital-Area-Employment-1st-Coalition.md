The Capital Area Employment 1st Coalition is collaboration of individuals from the local counties, service providers, employers, and community stakeholders who believe in several overarching principles related to employment for all individuals, including individuals with intellectual disabilities and autism.  They are committed to sharing the knowledge and resources that will make every individual a success story.  The core beliefs and values of the group include:
- Everyone can work and there is a real job for everyone. A real job is one with real wages and benefits, side-by-side with co-workers without disabilities.
- Not working should be the exception. All individuals, schools, families, and businesses must raise their expectations. 
- People will be hired because of their ability not because they have a disability. 
- Everyone has something to contribute. 
- Having a real job and earning wages helps people have a lifestyle with value, choice and empowerment. 
- Real jobs should be the first priority and preferred outcome for people with disabilities.
- Employment is a win/win for everybody!"
