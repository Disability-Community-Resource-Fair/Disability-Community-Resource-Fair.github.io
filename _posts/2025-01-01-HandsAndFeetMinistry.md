Hands and Feet Ministry is a community outreach organization that helps people with various needs around their home.  We complete projects on a monthly basis that include yard work, organization, painting, small home repair and small construction-type projects.  This is a group of volunteers who want to help others.  There are no income requirements; however, projects will be assessed for viability.
