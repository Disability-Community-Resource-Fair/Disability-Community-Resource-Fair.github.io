The Epilepsy Association of Western and Central PA (EAWCP) is a private, non-profit service organization providing public education and supportive services to individuals and families affected by epilepsy/seizure disorders. We endeavor to improve the quality of life for persons with epilepsy/seizure disorders, and to dispel the myths, stigma, and misunderstandings associated with epilepsy.
