                        We recognize that English proficiency may be a barrier to some in our community who are seeking resources for themselves or a loved one. We have volunteers with varying levels of proficiency in Mandarin and volunteers familiar with using voice to translation apps. We encourage you to contact us ahead of time so that we can be prepared to best assist you. You can also ask for assistance at the welcome table when you arrive.
