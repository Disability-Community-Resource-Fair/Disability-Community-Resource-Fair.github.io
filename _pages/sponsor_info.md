Events like this are made possible through support from our local community. We are asking local businesses to consider supporting the event through a monetary sponsorship or in-kind donations. In return, we will highlight your business on our Disability Community Resource Fair Facebook page, include it in promotional materials and media advisories, and post it on a display at the event that highlights your support.  

Gold, Silver, and Bronze sponsorship tiers are available. Please download the linked document above for details on tier benefits and instructions for registering. If you are unable to open and fill the document, please contact us for an alternative format.
